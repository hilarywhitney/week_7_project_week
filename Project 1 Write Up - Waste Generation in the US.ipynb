    "Waste has dramatically increased over the years from 1960 to 2010. The most dramatic increase occured between 1960 and 1970 with high growth of 40%. High year over year growth continued until 2000 when growth took a dramatic decrease to 2%. In terms of type of waste produced, the breakdown of Material, Durable Good, Non Durable Good, and Packaging/Container Waste was consistent throughout the years."

    "While recylcing rates were low in the 60s and 70s (7%), the US saw a large upswing in rates between 1990 and 2010 ending at 35%. Combustion also experienced a significant increase from the 1990s on. Looking at what type of material was combusted, there is an even breakdown between all waste categories other than Packaging/Containers (which do not undergo combustion). This is potentially due to the higher recycle rate of Packaging/Containers.  "
